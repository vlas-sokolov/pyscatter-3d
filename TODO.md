# Items on the to-do list:

- [x] Replace print warnings with logging messages
- [ ] Refactor into an OOP structure, this starts to feel a bit bulky
- [ ] Display all the info from parent .csv file on hover. [This might help](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/interactive-tooltip/)
- [ ] Add other plotting backends? Probably should look into vispy
- [ ] Allow input data from DisPerSE.
- [ ] Add errorbar plotting routines.
- [ ] Command-line functionality, with lists of .csv files passed as args
- [x] Enforce pep8!
- [x] Variable sizes do not work in matplotlib yet.
